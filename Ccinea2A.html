<h1>Parakeet Colors</h1>
<p>The normal primary color for parakeet is <b><span style="color: green;">green</span></b>.
This lets them hide better among tree leaves when they are pursued by predators.</p>
<p>The <b><span style="color: blue;">blue</span></b> color is a recent mutation, caused by the absence 
of <b><span style="color: yellow;">yellow</span></b> coloration from the original <b><span style="color: green;">green</span></b>.
 Although a popular color for pet birds, a <b><span style="color: blue;">blue</span></b> parakeet would probably not survive long in the wild</p>
